# AutoMatcher
I was in the market for a new car when I quickly realized that checking five different sites in order to comb through thousands of different models was going to take forever. So I created AutoMatcher, it pulls car data from an API in order to make it easy for the user to compare the specs of different makes and models.

### About

Whether you're after the best mileage, performance stats, or price AutoMatcher saves you time and hassle by putting all the necessary info you need in one spot.
